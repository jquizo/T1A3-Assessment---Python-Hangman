## Hangman - Python Terminal Game
Welcome to Hangman! This game was made using Python and runs on the terminal. The goal of the game is to guess the word one letter at a time, or guess the word before you run out of guesses (6 guesses). You get +10 points for each correct letter guess and +50 points for guessing the word in one go.

## R6 - Features
1. **Randomised words** - A random word is pulled from the words.py file using the **random** library. Each game selects a new random word
2. **Fully displayed hangman** - The game calls a function each time a guess is made, and the display hangman function is called to update and display the hangman art depending on how many tries left you have. Making an incorrect guess will reduce the amount of tries you have left and the correct hangman art will be shown. If you guess the word before you run out of your 6 tries you win!

3. **Leaderboard** - After a game, you get an option to enter your name, and your name and score will be added to the leaderboard. For each correct letter, you get +10 points. If you guess the word in one go, you get +50 points. (Unforunately leaderboards clear after closing the terminal)
